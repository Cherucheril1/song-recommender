# song-recommender
A continuation of a project made at HackTX 2019. It recommends a song on Spotify.

The user gives a Spotify username, a playlist that they like, a playlist that they dislike, and a playlist that they want to explore. Using the liked and disliked playlist, the program returns the songs from the 3rd playlist that the user may like.

Need to fix:
client_id and client_secret are public. Need to privatize them.
GUI doesn't look good.
