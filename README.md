# song-recommender
A continuation of a project made at HackTX 2019. It recommends a song on Spotify.

The program needs the client id and client secret of a developer account. 
The user gives a Spotify username, a playlist that they like, a playlist that they dislike, and a playlist that they want to explore. Using the data of the songs from the liked and disliked playlist, the program "learns" the user's musical taste. It then returns songs that it thinks are similar to the user's taste from the 3rd playlist that the user gave.
